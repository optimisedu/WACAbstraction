# WACAbstraction
Class to handle basic oscilation in the web audio context. Storing multiple oscilators in arrays allows for cleaner code and less memory usage.

## Next Todo ##

* Add a variety of distortions so instead of basic abstration this becomes a viable fx and synthessis tool
* If Libreries/Frameworks are used there will be obvious type benefits
